            <div id="character-description">A reluctant hero, Aang often acts in a fun-loving, carefree manner. His pacifist and vegetarian nature demonstrate his love for life, a primary trait of Buddhism. The creators intended Aang to defeat enemies with his wits and be a trickster hero. Though Aang generally acts in a playful, carefree manner, he becomes more serious during crisis and danger. Aang is rescued from a century of suspended animation by Katara and Sokka. The three of them go on a quest to teach Aang the three elements he does not know: Water, Earth, and Fire. Aang eventually learns Waterbending at the North Pole, Earthbending from Toph, and Firebending from Zuko. He also helps various groups of people throughout the Four Nations. Aang ultimately defeats the Fire Lord at the end of the series but does not take his life, further highlighting his opposition to violence. </div>
